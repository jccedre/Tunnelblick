# Because these items rarely change but take a lot of time to build, they are not
# "cleaned" when the Tunnelblick project is cleaned using Xcode.
#
# However, there are times when it is convenient to clean them. This can be accomplished
# by removing the third_party/do-not-clean file which was created when the third party
# items were last built.
#
# So, to do a clean build of the third party items, make sure that the
# third_party/do-not-clean file does not exist, and then build Tunnelblick normally.

# Make sure we have the correct version of tunnelblick.xcodeproj for the version of Xcode that we are using
